# aoc solutions

[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in Rust. The solutions all work, although I make no claims on code quality!

I aim for intelligible solutions and solve parts a and b separately. I solve first [here](https://github.com/maread99/aoc) in Python and then attempt to write solutions here that are idiomatic Rust rather than simply converting the Python code.

After solving I might write a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 220, 45)">rev</span>ised version to learn a better way of doing it or an <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(235, 220, 45)">alt</span>ernative version to learn a different way of doing it (references included where these were inspired by someone else's solution).

The README for each year serves as a reference of the key features of each solution.

## Useful resources
> :information_source: Last revised references Dec 2025
- [awesome-advent-of-code](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code) - the Awesome repo is pretty awesome, references to resources and solutions (by year / by language).
- [aoc subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode)

### Solutions
- [maneatingape](https://github.com/maneatingape/advent-of-code-rust) offers solutions in Rust for every aoc puzzle which collectively solve the lot in under half a second! The solutions are fully focused on speed which, for me at least, sometimes comes at the expense of intelligibility (although the author does include some documentation). If it's blazing fast aoc solutions in Rust that you're after, this _is_ the resource for you.
- [Michel Krämer](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/adventofcode-rust) offers solutions for almost every year. Nice clean, intelligible code with documentation. Avoids third-party libraries. Will even occassionally include a visualisation.
- [Connor Slade](https://github.com/connorslade/advent-of-code) has published solutions for all years since 2021. I've picked up lots of useful methods and idiomatic code from this repo.
